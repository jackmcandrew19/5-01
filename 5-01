# Create a program that will accept the two legs of a right-angle triangle, a and b, and display the length of the hypotenuse, c. 
# Remember to use prompts for the input and labels for the output. Use the formula a2 + b2 = c2 to calculate your answer.

# Prompt the user to enter the lengths of the two legs of the triangle
a = float(input("Enter the length of the first leg: "))
b = float(input("Enter the length of the second leg: "))

# Calculate the length of the hypotenuse using the formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2
c = (a**2 + b**2) ** 0.5

# Display the result with a label
print(f"The length of the hypotenuse is {c:.2f}")
